  * *Does gwt-jet have any dependencies?*
No. Of course you need GWT 2.2+, but then it's just a single jar file. The great GWT ENT libraries are provided inside the jar.
  * *What versions of GWT are supported?*
The project has been developed with GWT 2.2 and is also tested with 2.3 and 2.4. We hope next versions will be supported without major changes.
  * *Is it stable for a production environment?*
We developed gwt-jet thru 2011 aiming to solve the presentation layer of a big gwt project. The project is currently online and attending 500+ daily active users. Every issue detected was fixed before the first alpha release.
  * *What about performance?*
It will depend on the client computer specs, but a complex table with hundreds of rows behaves nicely on a standard pc. For thousands of rows and more, you just need to use [http://gwt-jet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javadoc/ar/com/kyol/jet/client/JetPaginatedTable.html JetPaginatedTable]. Anyway there's still a pending performance boost to be done as soon as we find the time, but probably nobody will notice it.
  * *Can I override the default css?*
Of course! Check Jet.css file located in the root of the jar, it's all there.
  * *Does it support internationalization?*
Yes. There are some words used in none standard widgets, so just copy and translate JetConstants.properties with your ISO language and country code suffixes and place it into a package named ar.com.kyol.client in your project.
