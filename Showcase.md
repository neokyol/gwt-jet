Check the online showcase [here](http://gwtjet.appspot.com/) or download it and run it yourself.

Requirements to be able to run it:

  * Maven 2.2.0 or later (optional but easier)
  * GWT 2.2.0 or later (pom will try to configure 2.4.0, but it'll work with 2.2.0)
  * Java 6
  * some web container (cooler if you use Jetty thru eclipse gwt plugin)


download from git-hub:
**git clone git://github.com/neokyol/gwt-jet-showcase.git**

or check [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/gwt-jet/downloads/list) page if you hate git
